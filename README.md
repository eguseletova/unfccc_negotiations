This code replicates the NLP exercises performed as part of my Master thesis.

The code takes news reports from UNFCCC negotiations in pdf format, combines the text, then extracts speaking turns for each country and negotiation bloc. Based on the text, a network of alignment and relative bargaining positions is constructed. 

The news reports are also compared to official UNFCCC decisions to evaluate how semantically close individual negotiation points are to the official resolution of the negotiation round.

Using all of these components, an index of relative success is constructed. This allows for specific investigation of how countries perform at international climate negotiations.
